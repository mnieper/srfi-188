<h1>Title</h1>

Splicing binding constructs for syntactic keywords

<h1>Author</h1>

Marc Nieper-Wißkirchen

<h1>Status</h1>

<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>Splicing binding constructs for syntactic keywords are versions
  of <code>let-syntax</code> and <code>letrec-syntax</code> that can
  be used in a definition context in the same way
  as <code>begin</code>.
</p>

<h1>Issues</h1>

<p>There are at least three sensible names for a splicing version
  of <code>let-syntax</code>,
  namely <code>splicing-let-syntax</code>, <code>let-syntax-splicing</code>,
  and <code>let-syntax/splicing</code>.  The same goes
  for <code>letrec-syntax</code>.  Racket
  uses <code>splicing-let-syntax</code>
  and <code>splicing-letrec-syntax</code>.  What is the best choice?
</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>The R7RS defines two binding constructs for syntactic keywords,
  namely <code>let-syntax</code> and <code>letrec-syntax</code>.  Both
  are equivalent to their R5RS versions and are expressions.</p>

<p>The R6RS versions of <code>let-syntax</code>
  and <code>letrec-syntax</code> are equivalent to the R5RS/R7RS
  version when they are not in a definition context.  In a definition
  context, however, the R6RS versions splice their body forms in the
  enclosing definition context.
</p>

<p>In some sense, the R6RS splicing versions are more fundamental than the
  R5RS/R7RS non-splicing versions as one can easily define the
  non-splicing versions by way of a <code>syntax-rules</code> macro in
  terms of the splicing versions.  Moreover, the non-splicing versions
  can also be defined by way of a <code>syntax-rules</code> macro in
  terms of the local <code>define-syntax</code>.
</p>

<p>On the other hand, the splicing versions cannot be defined through
  the non-splicing versions or <code>define-syntax</code>.
</p>

<p>The usefulness of the non-splicing versions seems to be
  non-controversional.  For
  example, <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-148/srfi-148.html#em
">SRFI
  148's <code>em</code> syntax</a> would become unnecessary.
</p>

<p>Thus, this SRFI proposes the non-splicing versions
  of <code>let-syntax</code> and <code>letrec-syntax</code> for R7RS
  under a different name.
</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><code>(splicing-let-syntax ((〈keyword〉 〈transformer spec〉) ...)
〈body〉)</code></p>

<p>Like <code>(let-syntax ((〈keyword〉 〈transformer spec〉) ...)
    〈body〉)</code> except that in a definition context, the body
  forms are spliced into the enclosing definition context (in the
  same way as for <code>begin</code>).  Essentially the R6RS version
  of <code>let-syntax</code>.
</p>

<p><code>(splicing-letrec-syntax ((〈keyword〉 〈transformer spec〉) ...)
〈body〉)</code></p>

<p>Like <code>(letrec-syntax ((〈keyword〉 〈transformer spec〉) ...)
    〈body〉)</code> except that in a definition context, the body
    forms are spliced into the enclosing definition context (in the
    same way as for <code>begin</code>).  Essentially the R6RS version
  of <code>letrec-syntax</code>.
</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>A portable R7RS implementation of the binding constructs described
  here is not possible.
</p>

<p>They are provided by any R6RS implementation.  The R7RS
  implementation Chibi Scheme also provides the binding constructs
  described here.
</p>

<p>They are also provided by Racket.</p>

<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

<p>The constructs described here aren't new but go back to the
R4RS/R5RS (in the non-splicing version) and the R6RS (in the splicing
version).  Thanks go to the editors of the (revised) reports on the
algorithmic language Scheme.
